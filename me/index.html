    <div class="fill">
      <p>I have three years' experience with web design using HTML and CSS, the primary topic of the camps. You can find my portfolio - and the websites I've created - at <a href="https://itbarsoum.netlify.app/" target="_blank">itbarsoum.netlify.app</a>. Some of the ones I'm most proud of are the <a href="https://www.projectforprivacy.org/" target="_blank">Project for a Private Web</a>, my <a href="https://socialjustice.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Social Justice Initiative</a>, and my <a href="https://climategame.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Climate Board Game</a>. You can find the source code in public repositories on <a href="https://github.com/itbarsoum99" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What coding experience do you have?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>I have significant experience in HTML/CSS, as well as some experience in Python, Bash, C, and JSON. Overall, I've been programming for five years now, with the last three dominated by an obsession with web design.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What if I want to learn to code myself?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>I'd encourage anyone to learn to code in any way they can, and there are several decent resources out there. Web design is best learned with personalized instruction and discussion, but <i><a href="https://learningwebdesign.com/">Learning Web Design</a></i> by Jennifer Robbins is an excellent resource for beginners.</p>
