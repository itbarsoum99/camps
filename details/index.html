    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <div class="faq">
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is the camp schedule?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>The first camp will be held from <hl>June 14-18</hl>. Each day, Zoom camps will be held from <hl>9:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET</hl>, with brain breaks and social time for campers in between.</p>
      <p>The second camp will be held from <hl>July 26-30</hl>. Each day, Zoom camps will be held from <hl>9:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET</hl>, with brain breaks and social time for campers in between.</p>
      <p>The third and final camp will be held from <hl>August 9-13</hl>. Each day, Zoom camps will be held from <hl>9:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET</hl>, with brain breaks and social time for campers in between.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Will the camps be in-person?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>The camps will <hl>not be in-person</hl>. This is for two major reasons. First, the COVID-19 pandemic is still a problem, and holding in-person events over several hours with unvaccinated people from several households is still a risk. Second, having the camps held virtually allows us to reach more people who may be interested, without location restrictions.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What will I learn by participating?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Campers will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and web strategies.</p>
      <p>Campers will apply these strategies by creating their own products.</p>
      <p>You can find a comprehensive curriculum/syllabus for the camp <a href="/programme/">here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is the cost?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>The cost is $50, all of which will be donated to <a href="https://www.e-2-d.org/">E2D</a>, a charity dedicated to "eliminating the digital divide" in the Charlotte, NC metropolitan area. If you are able, please consider donating more to help this cause. This donation is <hl>non-refundable</hl>. You can find the GoFundMe Charity <a href="https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/summer-coding-camps">here</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What are camp expectations?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Campers participating are expected to have their webcam on and be <hl>actively interacting</hl> in discussion and practice. <hl>This is <b>not</b> a "lecture camp."</hl> Campers will create a product of their own, ask questions, and receive feedback - they will not be sitting in Zoom, listening to me lecture for three hours. If you are uncomfortable actively participating, please do not sign up for the camp.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who can sign up?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Anyone from <hl>rising seventh-graders through rising tenth-graders</hl> can sign up to participate in the camp. In addition, rising sixth-graders that are twelve years old on or before August 1, 2021 can participate in the camps as well.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can I sign up?</button>
    <div class="fill">

This donation is <hl>non-refundable</hl>.

    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can a parent/guardian sit in?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p><hl>Parents and guardians are welcome to sit in on the camp</hl> with their child if they so desire. If you are a parent/guardian, you might just learn something, too! If you are planning to sit in on the camp to learn to code yourself, please consider making an additional donation of any amount to E2D (not required).</p>
